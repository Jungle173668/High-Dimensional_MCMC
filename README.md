Gaussian random walk Metropolis Hastings (GRW-MH) and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) method) are compared, when sampling latent variables on a 2D
domain.   

Code supplied in functions.py contains useful functions for generating matrices, plotting, and skeleton code to be completed.   

The files `simulation.py` and `spatial.py` contain the code to set up the problem and relevant plotting examples.  

The `partI.ipynb` and `ipynbII.ipynb` contains main process for this project.
